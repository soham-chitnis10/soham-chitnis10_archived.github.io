I am Soham Chitnis, currently a pre-final year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, K.K Birla Goa Campus, pursuing an undergrad in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. My research interests are **Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**. Currently, I am a Research Intern at TCS Research, where I am working on vision-language models for reasoning over plots for my undergraduate thesis. I have worked on developing a deep learning-based model for cancer diagnosis using histopathology images and the generation of novel drug molecules for cancer cure using Deep Graph Generators. I have worked on  Hyperspectral Images for the unmixing problem. I am a member of [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://www.saidl.in/). I am looking to collaborate on Open source and Research projects.
