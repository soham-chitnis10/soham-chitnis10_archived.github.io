I am Soham Chitnis, currently a pre-final year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science,K.K Birla Goa Campus pursuring undergrad in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. My research interests are **Computer Vision, Graph Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning and understanding the human perception through the deep neural networks**. I have worked on developing deep learning-based model for cancer diagnosis using histopathogy images and generation of novel drug molecules for cancer cure using Deep Graph Generators. At **The Kwon Lab for Low Vision and Brain Research**, my research focuses on understanding the statistical regularities which affect [Amodal completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amodal_completion) in the context of [Gestalt Laws of Grouping: Closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping).  I am a member of [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://www.saidl.in/). I am looking to collaborate on Open source and Research projects.
