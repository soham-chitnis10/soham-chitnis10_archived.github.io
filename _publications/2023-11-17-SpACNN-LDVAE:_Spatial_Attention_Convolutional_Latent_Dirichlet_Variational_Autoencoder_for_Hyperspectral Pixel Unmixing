### Abstract
The Hyperspectral Unxming problem is to find the pure spectral signal of the underlying materials (endmembers) and their proportions (abundances). The proposed method builds upon the recently proposed method, Latent Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE). It assumes that abundances can be encoded as Dirichlet Distributions while mixed pixels and endmembers are represented by Multivariate Normal Distributions. However, LDVAE does not leverage spatial information present in an HSI; we propose an Isotropic CNN encoder with spatial attention to solve the hyperspectral unmixing problem. We evaluated our model on Samson, Hydice Urban, Cuprite, and OnTech-HSI-Syn-21 datasets. Our model also leverages the transfer learning paradigm for Cuprite Dataset, where we train the model on synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world data. We are able to observe the improvement in the results for the endmember extraction and abundance estimation by incorporating the spatial information.
